Our first method avoids the use of stored tables and apparently requires 0(p ) operations. Our second algorithm, which may be regarded as a method of catching kangaroos, is applicable when the index is known to lie in a certain interval; it requires 0(w ) operations for an interval of width w, but does not have complete certainty of success. It has several possible areas of application, including the factorization of integers.},

This second-generation Onion Routing system addresses limitations in the original design by adding perfect forward secrecy, congestion control, directory servers, integrity checking, conﬁgurable exit policies, and a practical design for location-hidden services via rendezvous points. Tor works on the real-world Internet, requires no special privileges or kernel modiﬁcations, requires little synchronization or coordination between nodes, and provides a reasonable tradeoff between anonymity, usability, and efﬁciency. We brieﬂy describe our experiences with an international network of more than 30 nodes. We close with a list of open problems in anonymous communication.},

We give two applications to {RSA} encryption with exponent 3. First, knowledge of all the ciphertext and 2/3 of the plaintext bits for a single message reveals that message. Second, if messages are padded with truly random padding and then encrypted with an exponent 3, then two encryptions of the same message (with different padding) will reveal the message, as long as the padding is less than 1/9 of the length of N. With several encryptions, another technique can (heuristically) tolerate padding up to about 1/6 of the length of N.},

	abstract = {An encryption method is presented with the novel property that publicly revealing an encryption key does not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption key. This has two important consequences: (1) Couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit keys, since a message can be enciphered using an encryption key publicly revealed by the intented recipient. Only he can decipher the message, since only he knows the corresponding decryption key. (2) A message can be “signed” using a privately held decryption key. Anyone can verify this signature using the corresponding publicly revealed encryption key. Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot later deny the validity of his signature. This has obvious applications in “electronic mail” and “electronic funds transfer” systems. A message is encrypted by representing it as a number M, raising M to a publicly specified power e, and then taking the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly specified product, n, of two large secret primer numbers p and q. Decryption is similar; only a different, secret, power d is used, where e * d ≡ 1(mod (p - 1) * (q - 1)). The security of the system rests in part on the difficulty of factoring the published divisor, n.},
